# Factorizing Affine Maps
This repository is a companion to the paper "Reuse Analysis via Affine Factorization", submitted to the [IMPACT '24 workshop](https://impact-workshop.org/).
The [Jupyter notebook here](./Factorization of Affine Maps.ipynb) demonstrates the process by which affine maps can be factorized using the [Integer Set Library (ISL)](https://libisl.sourceforge.io/).
The [islpy](https://documen.tician.de/islpy/) Python library is used to call into the ISL library.
